# 1. Creating a Class: Define a Python class called Person with attributes name and age. Implement a method called introduce that prints out the name and age of the person.

# class Person :
#     def print_name(self,name):
#         print("person name:",name)
#     def print_age(self,age):
#         print("person age:  ",age)
# a=Person()
# a.print_name("prachi")
# a.print_age(20)
        

# 2. Creating Objects: Create two instances of the Person class with different names and ages, and call the introduce method for each object.

# class Person:
#     def __init__(self,name, age):
#             self.name = name
#             self.age = age
#     def introduce(self):
#         print("person name: ",self.name)
#         print("person age: ",self.age)
# a=Person("prachi",20)
# b=Person("siddarth",20)
# a.introduce()
# b.introduce()


# 3. Inheritance - Single: Create a class Student that inherits from the Person class. Add an additional attribute student_id to the Student class. Override the introduce method to include the student's ID.

# class Person:
#     def __init__(self,name, age):
#             self.name = name
#             self.age = age
#     def introduce(self):
#         print("person name: ",self.name)
#         print("person age: ",self.age)
    
# class Student(Person):
#     def __init__(self,name,age,id):
#         super().__init__(name,age)
#         self.stud_id = id
#     def introduce(self):
#         super().introduce()
#         print("my id is ",self.stud_id)   
# info=Student("prachi",20,27)
# info.introduce()


# 4. Multiple Inheritance: Create two parent classes A and B. Then, create a child class C that inherits from both A and B. Add a method show_info to class C that prints "This is class C".

# class A:
#     def print_A(self):
#         print("This is class A")

# class B:
#     def print_B(self):
#         print("This is class B")

# class C(A,B):
#     def show_info(self):
#         print("This is class C")
# a=C()
# a.show_info()
    

# 5. Multilevel Inheritance: Define three classes Vehicle, Car, and ElectricCar. Car inherits from Vehicle, and ElectricCar inherits from Car. Each class should have a method drive() which prints a message specific to that class.

# class Vehicle:
#     def v_drive(self):
#         print("This is class Vehicle")
# class Car(Vehicle):
#     def print_drive(self):
#         print("This is class Car")
# class electricCar(Car):
#     def drive(self):
#         print("This is class electricCar")
# a=electricCar()
# a.drive()
# a.print_drive()
# a.v_drive()
    
    
# 6. Accessing Parent Class Methods: In a multilevel inheritance scenario similar to the previous question, add a method show_info to the Vehicle class. Then, in the ElectricCar class, call the show_info method of the Vehicle class.

# class Vehicle:
#     def v_show_info(self):
#         print("This is class Vehicle")
# class Car(Vehicle):
#     def  c_show_info(self):
#         print("This is class Car")
# class electricCar(Car):
#     def show_info(self):
#         print("This is class electricCar")
# a=electricCar()
# a.v_show_info()
# a.c_show_info()
# a.show_info()

#  7. Overriding Methods: Create a parent class Shape with a method area that returns 0. Then, create child classes Rectangle and Triangle that override the area method to calculate the area of a rectangle and a triangle, respectively.

# class Shape:
#     def area(self):
#         return 0
    
# class Rectangle(Shape):
#     def __init__(self,l,w):
#         self.l =l
#         self.w=w
#     def area (self):
#         print("Area of rectangle",self.l*self.w)


# class Triangle(Shape):
#     def __init__(self,b,h):
#         self.b=b
#         self.h=h
#     def area (self):
#         print("Area of triangle",(self.b*self.h)/2)
        
# a=Rectangle(10,5) 
# b=Triangle(5,8) 
# a.area()
# b.area()


# 8. Using super(): In a multilevel inheritance scenario, modify the show_info method of the Vehicle class to print "This is a vehicle". Then, in the Car class, use super() to call the show_info method of the Vehicle class, and add "This is a car" to the output.

# class Vehicle:
#     def show_info(self):
#         print("This is class Vehicle")
# class Car(Vehicle):
#     def  show_info(self):
#         super().show_info()
#         print("This is class Car")
# class electricCar(Car):
#     def show_info(self):
#         super().show_info()
#         print("This is class electricCar")
        
# a=electricCar()
# a.show_info()



# 9. Class Variables and Methods: Create a class Employee with a class variable num_of_employees initialized to 0. Increment this variable every time a new employee is created. Implement a class method get_num_of_employees that returns the total number of employees.

# 10. Static Methods: Add a static method is_adult(age) to the Person class that takes an age as input and returns True if the age is 18 or above, otherwiseÂ False.

# 1 Create a Python class called BankAccount. Define an init() method that initializes the account_number, balance, and account_holder attributes. Create methods for deposit, withdrawal, and displaying account details.


# class BankAccount:
#     def __init__(self, account_no, balance, account_holder):
#         self.account_no = account_no
#         self.balance = balance
#         self.account_holder = account_holder
#     def deposite (self,amount):
#         print(f"{amount} deposited successfully")
#     def withdral (self,amount):
#         print(f"{amount} withdrawal successfully")
#     def displaying (self):
#         print("displaying successfully")
# a=BankAccount()


# 2 Create a subclass called SavingsAccount, inheriting from the BankAccount class. Define an init() method that also initializes the interest_rate attribute. Override the deposit method to include interest calculation.

# class BankAccount:
#     def __init__(self, account_no, balance, account_holder):
#         self.account_no = account_no
#         self.balance = balance
#         self.account_holder = account_holder
#     def deposite (self,amount):
#         print(f"{amount} deposited successfully")
#     def withdral (self,amount):
#         print(f"{amount} withdrawal successfully")
#     def displaying (self):
#         print("displaying successfully")
        
# class SavingsAccount(BankAccount):
#     def __init__ (self,account_no,balance,account_holder,interest_rate):
#         self.interest_rate = interest_rate
#         super().__init__(account_holder,account_no,balance)
#     def simple_interest(self,period,principal,amount):
#         print("your interest ",(period*principal*self.interest_rate)/100)
#         super().deposite(amount)
#         super().displaying()
        
# obj=SavingsAccount(
#     input("Enter your name: "),
#     int(input("Enter account no:")),
#     int(input("Enter account balance:")),
#     int(input("Enter rate of interest:"))
# )

# obj.simple_interest(
#     int(input("Enter loan principal:")),
#     int(input("Enter loan period:")),
#     int(input("Enter your deposite amount:")),
    
# )
        
        
# 3 Create another subclass called CheckingAccount, also inheriting from the BankAccount class. Define an init() method that also initializes the transaction_limit attribute. Override the withdrawal method to check if the withdrawal amount exceeds the transaction limit.

# class BankAccount:
#     def __init__(self, account_holder,account_no,balance):
#         self.account_no = account_no
#         self.balance = balance
#         self.account_holder = account_holder
#     def deposite (self,amount):
#         print(f"{amount} deposited successfully")
#         self.balance += amount
#     def withdrawal (self,amount):
#         print(f"{amount} withdrawal successfully")
#         self.balance -= amount
#     def displaying (self):
#         print(f"{self.account_holder} your account no is: {self.account_no}")
#         print(f"{self.balance} your balance is: {self.balance}")
        
# class CheckingAccount(BankAccount):
#     def __init__(self,account_holder,account_no,balance=10000 ,transaction_limit=8000):
#         self.transaction_limit = transaction_limit
#         super().__init__(account_holder,account_no,balance)
#     def withdrawal(self,amount):
#         if amount<self.transaction_limit and amount<self.transaction_limit:
#             self.balance-=amount
#             print(f"{amount} withdrawal successfully your current balance is:{self.balance}")
            
#         elif  self.transaction_limit<amount:
#             print(f" withdrawal amount exceeds your transaction limit")

#         else:
#             print("insufficient balance to withdraw")
            
# obj=CheckingAccount(

# student1.display()


        
# 15. Develop a class hierarchy for a vehicle rental system. Create a base class Vehicle with attributes make, model, and year. Then, create subclasses Car, Truck, and SUV. Ensure that each subclass initializes these attributes using super() and provides additional attributes specific to theÂ vehicleÂ type.
